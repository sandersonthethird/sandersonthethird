## Hello world 👋

In 1989 I coded a BrickBreaker clone in BASIC for the Apple IIGS.  
In 1990 I coded Hunt the Wumpus in Pascal for MS-DOS.  
In 1998 I coded a Tetris clone in C for Linux.
I thought I'd seen and done it all.
I've come back from retirement.
Thank you AI.
Thank you Expo.  
Thank you Claude Code.
